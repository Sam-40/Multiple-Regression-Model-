# Multiple-Regression-Model
The purpose of this project is to demonstrate how multiple regression model fits into Professors salary prediction and interpret their coefficients using R studio. Here we will use different types of regression models to find out which is the better model based on the analysis.

Data set: The dataset contains
397 observations with 6 variables.
5 independent variables and 1 dependent variable.
Here we used multiple regression models like simple linear regression model, multi regression model, full regression model and Best fit model.
Below are the variable wise descriptions:
•	Rank: observations are at “Prof”, “Asst Prof” and “Assoc Prof level.
•	Discipline: Namely two departments A and B.
•	Yrs.since.Phd: Years since PHD completion
•	Yrs.service: Number of years in service
•	Sex: Gender of the disciple
•	Salary: Salary of the disciple.

ANALYSIS:
From the above assumptions, we can say that Linearity condition is satisfied. Data is slightly deviated in normality condition but it can be improved by making changes in independent variables and having more observations. Equality condition of the dataset is satisfied but, we can see few outliers in the dataset.
